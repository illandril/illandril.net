        `"The trees here are massive, nothing like they are back home."`,
        `"Really. And they seem so much different too. More like many thin trees tangled together than just one."`,
        `"The leaves are different too, kind of funny looking."`,
        `"The trees aren't that important though, huh? Lets get moving."`,
        `"Right, right. Where are we going anyway?"`,
        `"This way."`,
        `"Gee... thanks."`,
        `"Don't worry, nothing dangerous. The path is just like it is here the whole way."`,
        `"What excitement. Dead leaves, weird trees, and random sticks to trip on... *grumbles*"`,
        `"Would you prefer taking the swamp route?"`,
        `"No, I suppose not. This place could be a bit more interes... hey! what's that?"`,
        `"What's what?"`,
        `"That shiny thing in the brush over there."`,
        `"I don't know... *walks over and picks up the key* Looks like someone's old chest key. Probably been here for months it's so rusted."`,
        `"I don't see anything on it that would make it shine... why was it reflecting light?"`,
        `"*moves his hand from the center of the shaft to the end* Band in the center's made of rubies."`,
        `"That's odd."`,
        `"Yeah. Oh well."`,
        `"*stumbles on something* Ack. *looks down* Ah man. I dropped my traveler's cup thing and stepped on it..."`,
        `"I told you it's better to bring a mug with a handle than that flimsy thing. A mug you can tie down. That thing is too smooth, and could fall easily, and no handle to tie down. Pick up the pieces and let's get moving."`,
        `"*picks up pieces and continues walking* Hey. Is that where we're going over there?"`,
        `"That dump? Nah."`,
        `"Dump? That place is gorgeous. Has to be made of the finest marble around!"`,
        `"If a leaf fell on that place it would crumble to dust I tell you."`,
        `"No way. Finest craftsmanship I've ever seen in a mansion of that sty... y... y..."`,
        `"What's wrong? Cat got your ton... never mind. The bear does."`,
        `"Ih... ih..."`,
        `"You wuss. *walks up to the bear and pats it on the head*"`,
        `"Wha... how... why..."`,
        `"Never seen a bear harm a soul in this forest, probably never will."`,
        `"I have you."`,
        `"I know. *grins*"`,
        `*both jump as a loud crashing sound fills the area*`,
        `"See! I told you it was a dump."`,
        `"I guess you were right. Nothing even touched the place as far as I can tell."`,
        `"Haha! The place is burning. Fine marble my ass!"`,
        `"Marble... doesn't... ignite..."`,
        `"I'll give 'em credit for the paint job, but that thing was never going to last."`,
        `"How can someone make wood look that much like marble?"`,
        `"Got me. Think we should do something about those flames?"`,
        `"I think nature's got that covered. *points to rain clouds just before it starts pouring*"`,
        `"Saves that trouble... but I still hate rain."`,
        `"So where are we going?"`,
        `"I told you already. This way *turns and continues down the path*"`,
        `"*walk walk walk* What's that noise... *turns head, turns back and friend is gone* Hey! Where'd you go?"`,
