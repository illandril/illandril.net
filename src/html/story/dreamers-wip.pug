    | I started writing "Dreamers" in January 2014. It's the first serious writing I've done since college.
    | I initially expected it to be a short story, but it kept growing and growing the more I wrote, so now I know it will at least be a novella, if not a novel.
    | Here's an excerpt from what is currently the start of Chapter 4:

  +storyLine "I'm having another dream," said Laenia.
  +storyLine Toryn jumped slightly when she spoke. He too had been preoccupied with the mystery of this new place. "What?" he asked.
  +storyLine "I must be in a dream. That's the only thing this can be. It's too warm and too pretty here for anything else to make sense."
  +storyLine "A dream... of course. Why'd you have to come into my dream and ruin it by telling me I was dreaming?" asked Toryn.
